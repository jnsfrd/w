          <h5>The importance of distributed setup information in federated machine learning</h5>
          <p>
            This video underscores the critical importance of understanding the distributed setup used in training federated machine learning models. Without this information, any reports on the model remain incomplete. Key details, including the number of participating clients, data distribution, communication costs, and the total time required for training, are essential for ensuring transparency and building confidence in the model’s effectiveness.

          <h5>Cross-device federated machine learning</h5>
          <p><small>
            Federated machine learning for cross-device use cases is a critical yet complex research area. It demands a deep understanding of machine learning processes, distributed computing, and the unique constraints of edge devices. One of the major challenges lies in creating an experimental environment that accurately simulates real-world conditions.
